      The wavespectrum as computed by Norsea. It shows the wave energy over time relative to the ship.
      The closer the waves are to the center, the lower their frequency is, and therefore the longer the wave period.
      When more than 1 hotspot is visible, the vessel is likely experiencing mixed waves from 2 different directions.
      The intensity is correlated to the wave height: low values (&#60; 100) indicate low waves (or harbour) whilst high
      values (>200)
      indicate significant waves. The gap in the middle is a result of the radars maximum range, which equals 0.04 Hz
      (waves with period up to 25 seconds). Heading of the vessel is indicated via the red arrow.
