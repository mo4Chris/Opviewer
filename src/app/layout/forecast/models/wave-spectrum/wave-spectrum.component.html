    Wave spectrum which was used to compute the workability. The graph
    shows the direction the waves are coming from, i.e. a peak at 45 degrees
    in the north-east indicates a wave from the north-east moving towards the
    south-west. The white lines show the wave period. This means that a peak
    close to the center corresponds short-crested waves (usually wind waves),
    whilst peaks further out correspond to long-crested swell waves.
