    Wave spectrum for which workability has been computed. The graph
    shows the direction the waves are coming from, i.e. a peak at 45 degrees
    in the north-east indicates a wave from the north-east moving towards the
    south-west. Higher spectral energy indicates higher waves. A peak close
    to the center implies short-crested waves (usually wind waves), whilst
    peaks towards the edges correspond to long-crested swell waves.
